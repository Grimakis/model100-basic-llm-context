# Address Organizer (ADDRSS) Quick Reference

## Using the Address Program
ADDRS uses a file called `ADRS.DO`. To store addresses, highlight `ADRS.DO` (if it exists) or highlight TEXT and press ENTER to start editing with the Text Editor. To look up addresses, highlight `ADDRSS` and press ENTER.

## Special Commands and Keys within ADDRSS
- `Find string (F1)`: Search ADRS.DO for the target. If the string occurs multiple times, ADDRSS shows a screenful and prompts for “More” or “Quit.” Pressing the alternate find keys (F2 or F3) shows the next screenful, and F4 ends the search.
- `(F5) Lfnd string`: Same as Find, but sends the results directly to the printer instead of the screen.
- `F8 Menu`: Exit ADDRSS and return to the Menu.
