# Scheduler (SCHEDL) Quick Reference

## Using the Scheduler Program
The Scheduler uses a data file named `NOTE.DO`. To enter data into NOTE.DO, highlight NOTE.DO (if the file already exists) or highlight TEXT and press ENTER; either way you get full access to the Text Editor. Once NOTE.DO exists, highlight SCHEDL at the Menu and press ENTER to search or edit.

## Special Commands and Keys within SCHEDL
- `(F1) Find string`: Search NOTE.DO for the next occurrence of the target. If the string appears more than once, SCHEDL shows a screenful of the match and prompts for “More” or “Quit.” (F2) or (F3) shows the next screenful, while (F2) or (F4) ends the Find.
- `(F5) Lfind string`: Identical to Find, except results go directly to the printer instead of the screen.
- `F8 Menu`: Exit SCHEDL and return to the Menu.
